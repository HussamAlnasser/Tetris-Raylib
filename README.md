As I mentioned in my previous project (<a href="https://github.com/HussamAlnasser/CMD-Tetris">CMD-Tetris</a>), the best way to learn a programming language is making a game, particularly Tetris. This time, I decided to build a Tetris clone to learn about this open source game library in C and C++ called Raylib.

The algorithm for the gameplay is based on the C file of the last project, except this time I decided to split the code into different files to make the architecture more felxible and to add more features, such as an animated title.

Much of the art was based on assets from other games, such as the Tetra blocks from "Tetris & Dr. Mario", and others I downloaded online and will provide attributions at the end of the README.
